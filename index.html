                <h1>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni</h1>
                <p>
                   Michelangelo was one of the greatest artists during the Italian Renaissance, and is still considered one of the best today. He was a painter, scultpor, architect and poet all in one. Both his paintings and scultptures are considered some of the best in art history. Michelangelo considered himself a sculptor even though his work on the Sistine Chapel is what he is most famous for. This body of work is aspecially famous for his time because many great works remained unfisnihed while this one was eventually completed with great attention to detail. Throughout his career, Michelangelo mainly sculpted out of marble, even though he painted as well.

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                   Michelangelo Buonarroti was born on March 6th, 1475, in Caprese, Italy. This is a city near Florence. His father was the local magistrate and worked for various government jobs. Michelangelo was born to a family that belonged to a minor nobility in Florence for several generations. When he was a month old, the family moved back to Florence. Michelangelo had four brothers and his mother died when he was just six. His father tried to discourage him from becoming an artist because it was considered below the family's social status, but eventually gave in.

                <h2>Later Life</h2>
                <p>
                   As he approached his death in 1564, Michelangelo continued to sculpt and paint. However, the main focus of his work towards the end of his life was scultpure. Michelangelo designed the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, which was completed after he died. He left Forence for Rome where he lived permanently. Before he died, Michelangelo began work in the late 1540s on a pieta that was intended for his own tomb, but what never completed. Michelangelo died of an illness in 1564 at the age of 88, outliving the average lifespan. He left a great legacy through his work and contninues to be revered as one of the greatest artists of the Italian Rennaisance.
