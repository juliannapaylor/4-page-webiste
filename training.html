                <h1>Early Training</h1>
                <p>
                  At the age of 13, Michelangelo began apprenticing to Domenico Ghirlandaio, who was famous for his works in chapels and cathedrals. When Michelangelo turned 14 years old, Ghirlandaio started paying for him to continue working as an apprentice. This was unusual for apprentices during the time. Even as a teenager, Michelangelo showed great promise and talent. Michelangelo's training was far from over though...
                </p>
                <h1>Further Training</h1>
                <p>In 1489, Ghirlandaio was asked by Lorenzo de Midici, the ruler of Florence, for his best two students for further education. Michelangelo was chosen to study at Florence's Humanist Academy. This met in de Medici's garden. Michelangelo studied under the medalist and sculptor Bertoldo di Giovanni. He was a students under Donatello.
